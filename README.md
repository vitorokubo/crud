## Project Description
A simple CRUD project for item registration, with listing, editing, adding, and removing of products. The objective of the project was to deliver a simple CRUD quickly in half a day, using a limited scope of technologies and only one html file. The challenge was to use only Vanilla Javascript and Bootstrap. The data is stored in local storage. I chose to leave the code separate from the html, but I could have integrated it into a single html file.

## How to start the project
To start the project, you only need to have the live server extension installed in vscode. If you want to see the project online [link](https://vitorokubo.github.io/crud).

## Improvements to be made
Refactor and organize the code. Replicate the project with a framework.

## Challenges encountered
The biggest challenge was using Vanilla Javascript, which made the project more lengthy to write.
